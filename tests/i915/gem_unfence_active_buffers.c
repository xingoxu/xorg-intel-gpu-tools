/** @file gem_unfence_active_buffers.c
 *
 * Testcase: Check for use-after free in the fence stealing code
 *
 * If we're stealing the fence of a active object where the active list is the
 * only thing holding a reference, we need to be careful not to access the old
 * object we're stealing the fence from after that reference has been dropped by
 * retire_requests.
 *
 * Note that this needs slab poisoning enabled in the kernel to reliably hit the
 * problem - the race window is too small.
